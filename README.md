- 👋 Hi, I’m Abubakar Aliyu
- 👀 I’m interested in Machine learning, Data science, Artificial Intelligence, Cloud Computing, and Opportunistic/Delay Tolerant Network
- 🌱 I’m currently learning and evaluating the buffer management techniques and routing protocols in DTN using ONE Simulator
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project that might help in enhancing and subsequently come up with an effective buffer technique in DTN. My door is also open for collaboration in areas of ML, AI and Data science
- 📫 How to reach me ..
